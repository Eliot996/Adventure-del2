                Here is some help for you. Hopefully this will make your journey easier:
                1) To move in and out of different rooms, combine 'go' with a direction,
                   such as north, south, east or west, or simply use the starting letter of the direction.
                5) type 'look', to get a description of the room you are in.
                6) type 'exit', to end the game.
                I wish you the best of luck!
